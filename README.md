# SysML-v2-API-Cookbook
The SysML v2 API Cookbook repository is a collection of API recipes to demonstrate patterns and examples for using the [SysML v2 API & Services](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-API-Services).

In the current release, the cookbook contains recipes that use the SysML v2 REST/HTTP API (PSM). Each recipe is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with a sequence of API calls to the SysML v2 REST/HTTP API.
